 📊 TMDB Movie Analysis

This project presents an exploratory data analysis of movie information sourced from The Movie Database (TMDB) using Python’s data-science ecosystem. The goal is to investigate patterns in movie performance, such as revenue, budget behavior, popularity trends, and genre characteristics, while demonstrating effective use of pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for real-world analytics.

The analysis begins with data cleaning and preparation, including handling missing values, converting date formats, normalizing numerical fields, and extracting additional features such as release year and genre categories. These steps ensure reliable downstream insights. Using pandas and numpy, the dataset is explored to summarize central tendencies, distribution shapes, correlations, and notable outliers. Visualizations created with matplotlib and seaborn highlight key patterns, enabling intuitive interpretation of trends over time and across genres.

Key questions examined include:

* How do budget and revenue relate, and what trends exist across decades?
* Which genres consistently perform well in terms of revenue or user ratings?
* How has movie production volume changed over time?
* What factors are associated with higher popularity scores?

The repository includes the analysis notebook, optional images of generated figures, and instructions to reproduce results. Users can clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the dataset interactively.

This project serves as a practical example of using Python for data exploration, and it can be extended with additional datasets, machine-learning models, or API-powered data retrieval. Contributions are welcome from anyone interested in enhancing visualizations, improving code structure, or expanding the analytical scope.
